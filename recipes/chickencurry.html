    <p class="title">Chicken curry</p>
    <p> For lunch, I personally prefer something relatively healthy with a lot of proteins for muscle growth,
        the following recipe takes about 35minutes cooking time, but it's worth it!
    </p>
    <p class="titles">Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>400g chicken breasts</li>
        <li>100g basmatti rice</li>
        <li>500 ml cream for cooking</li>
        <li>1 medium onion</li>
        <li>3 cloves of fresh garlic</li>
        <li>1 beefstock cube</li>
        <li>fresh ginger</li>
        <li>parsley</li>
        <li>salt, pepper, smoked paprika, granulated garlic, curry</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="titles">Steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the chicken in cubes, marinate them by your own taste, start by:
            <ol>
                <li>add 1tsp of oil</li>
                <li>add salt,pepper,smoked paprika, granulated garlic</li>
                <li>mix thoroughly and let it rest while you start step2</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Cut 1 medium onion in cubes and start sauteing in a pot with a tsp of oil,
            once the onion gets transparent, crush 1 beefstock cube in and mix, then add the rice,
            and mix for aproximatelly 2min, then add water, cover the pot and let it slowly boil for 25 minutes
        </li>
        <li>Oil up a pan, pour in the marinated chicken and start cooking it on medium for cca 12 minutes so
            it nicely golden and brown, crush in the 3 cloves of garlic and cook for 1 minute (<em>overcooking
                the garlic, makes it taste dreadful.</em>) Pour in the cream and boil everything on low heat for 10
                minutes, add freshly grated ginger and curry powder and cook for 5 more minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Put the freshly cooked rice in a bowl, and pour the chicken curry onto it</li>
        <li>Top it of with some fresh parsley and enjoy :)</li>
    </ol>
    <p><em><strong>Sidenote:</strong>for a more rich flavour, cook 3 cubed onions before adding the chicken and add some fresh cherry tomatoes.
         Add some peanuts at the end to apply crunchiness to the dish</em></p>
