    <p class="title">Protein breakfast</p>
    <p>The dish is simple and made fast, It contains only about 500 kcal, It does contain about 40g of protein tho.</p>
    <p>The dish can be made in the evening for the next day, served cold, or in the morning served hot</p>

    <p class="titles">Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>0.3 l of 1,5% low fat milk</li>
        <li>1 scoop (33g) of desired whey protein powder mixed in 0.1 l of water</li>
        <li>0.3 l of water</li>
        <li>80g of oatmeal</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="titles">Steps:</p>
    <ol>
<li>Put the milk and the water in a pot and start brewing it on medium heat</li>
<li>While the fluids are warming up, in a separate bowl, mix
    the scoop of protein powder with 0.1 of water untill smooth, in another bowl, weigh and prepare 
    your 80g of oatmeal.</li>
    <li>When the fluids start to mildly boil, add the oatmeal and mix constantly for aproximatelly 5 minutes.</li>
<li>After 5 minutes the meal should be thicker, like a yogurt, that's when you add the protein fluid and proceed mixing and cooking It
    for another minute.
</li>
<li>Remove the pan from the heat, pour it into a bowl (its supposed to be like a thick yogurt or a runny pudding</li>
<li>Eat fresh and hot, or let it rest through the night and eat a thicker cold pudding the next day</li>
<p>Side note:</p>
<p><em>If you don't mix constantly, the bottom starts to burn,
    for the very same reason we add the protein at the end of cooking.
</em></p>
<p><em>Wash the pot after pouring the breakfast out, so it doesnt harden and stick to it</em></p>
    </ol>
